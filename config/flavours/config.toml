# You can also set a shell (outside items) on which to run hooks
# Check flavours repository for more information and examples


# Explanation and default values for keys:

# # Through which shell command hooks will run. The command will be replaced in '{}'
# shell = "sh -c '{}'"

# file = "~/.config/example"

# # If not rewriting, on which line (usually a comment) to start replacing
# start = "# Start flavours"
# # If not rewriting, on which line (usually a comment) to stop replacing
# end = "# End flavours"
# # Should we rewrite the entire file, instead of using the above delimiters?
# rewrite = false
# # Command to execute after injecting (goes through shell)
